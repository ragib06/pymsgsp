Dear all,

We have started our first project. The deadline is Sept 29, 2015. The
attached are two sample files: one is the data file, and the other is the
parameter file. Note that SDC means support difference constraint. The final
test files for demo will be of the same format, but will only be given to
you on Sept 29, 2015 at the noon time.

Your output file should look like this:

The number of length 1 sequential patterns is 20
Pattern:  <{2}>  Count:  4
.....

The number of length 2 sequential patterns is 7
Pattern:  <{2}{5}>  Count:  1
......

The number of length 3 sequential patterns is 5
Pattern:  <{2}{5}{7}>  Count:  1
